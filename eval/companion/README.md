# Companion Eval Harness

Regression-test infrastructure for the companion (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-21-companion-eval-harness-design.md`). Re-run scripted multi-day user trajectories against a real daemon + real SDK subprocesses; get a markdown report.

## Run

```bash
bun run eval:companion                                          # all trajectories
bun run eval:companion --trajectory tech_stress_followup_v1     # one
```

Output: `eval/companion/runs/<timestamp>/report.md` plus per-trajectory `.jsonl` raw dumps.

## Expected cost

Each trajectory boots a real daemon and dispatches real Claude SDK calls. Rough wall time on a warm laptop: **~30–60s per event** (SDK cold-start dominates). The two MVP trajectories together are ~4–8 minutes plus judge calls (one judge call per probe-with-dimensions). Don't run on every commit.

## Add a trajectory

1. Pick a `failure_mode` from `engine/trajectory.ts` `FAILURE_MODES`.
2. Copy an existing YAML in `trajectories/` and edit.
3. Each probe needs an `expected` block. Split is:
   - **Engine asserts** (boolean): `decision`, `must_recall`, `must_not_recall`, `state_predicates`.
   - **Judge scores** (1–5): `summary`, `tone_hints`, and any `dimensions: [...]` you list.
4. Smoke-load: `bun -e "import { loadTrajectory } from './eval/companion/engine/trajectory'; loadTrajectory('./eval/companion/trajectories/<file>.yaml')"`
5. Run: `bun run eval:companion --trajectory <id>`
6. **Multi-contact trajectories** (e.g. `cross_chat_isolation`): use `contacts:` (a list of contacts) instead of `contact:`. The first contact is the primary. Tag each `user_message` / `tick` / `probe` event with `chat: <chat_id>` to target a specific contact; events without `chat:` target the primary. Exactly one of `contact:` / `contacts:` must be present. Note: `tick` events always fire against `companion_config.default_chat_id` — a `chat:` on a tick is not honored.

## Judge config

`judge-config.json` selects the judge backend:

```json
{ "kind": "claude-sdk", "model": "claude-opus-4-7" }
```

Backends: `claude-sdk` (MVP), `codex-sdk` (stub), `anthropic-api` (stub). Adding a new backend = implement `Judge` in a new file and register the `kind` in `run.ts`'s `loadJudge`.

## Interpreting a report

- ✅ / ❌ next to engine assertions are objective pass/fail. Investigate any ❌.
- Judge dimension scores (1–5) are subjective. Use them for **trend** detection, not absolute correctness. Repeated runs of the same trajectory should land within ±2 on each dimension; wider swings = either model non-determinism (noise) or a real change worth investigating.
- "Errors" in the header = trajectories where a probe captured an exception (timeout, judge JSON parse fail). One error doesn't fail the run — replay continues — but they should be near zero on a healthy day.

## What's NOT in MVP

- (All 8 failure modes now have at least one trajectory.)
- Multi-seed judge averaging, pairwise blind comparison
- CI integration — explicit manual run only
- Codex / Anthropic-API judge backends (interfaces exist; bodies throw)

See the spec for the rationale on each.

## Acceptance run 2026-05-29 — results + one harness bug found

First full real-SDK run of the 6 new trajectories. Engine assertions pass for
cross_domain_mixing, explicit_quiet, wrong_inference_correction,
fact_update_supersede, and cross_chat_isolation (whose isolation guarantee held —
the chat_a deploy reply leaked nothing from chat_b's private fact).

**Harness bug found and fixed (commit ad829ad).** The first run showed empty
replies on the *2nd+ message to a chat* (fact_update recall, wrong_inference
Probe 2). Root cause: `waitForReplyTo` waited on `outbox.some(chat)` over the
cumulative outbox, so a later message resolved instantly off the *prior* reply —
the harness raced ahead, captured nothing, and could tear the daemon down before
the message was dispatched. The two MVP trajectories never caught it (one message
per chat). Fixed via `waitForNewReply` (waits for the chat's reply count to grow);
regression test in `daemon-shim.test.ts`. Re-run confirms the companion answers
correctly — fact_update: "mysql，今天从 postgres 迁过来的。"; wrong_inference:
"那挺好。在搞什么？" (accepts the correction, no pity).

`fact_update`'s `must_not_recall:postgres` was dropped afterward: a substring
check can't distinguish "postgres is current" (the failure) from "migrated from
postgres" (correct context) — `must_recall:mysql` + the `calibration` judge
dimension carry that intent instead.

**`long_silence_initiative` — resolved by Companion Proactivity v1; e2e proactive
still flaky (now the fire-prompt skip valve, not virtual time).** The original finding (push tick didn't
resurface open threads, judge `initiative:1`/`recall:1`) was root-caused to the
push tick being a cold "should I?" poll. Fixed by the proactivity v1 model
(`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-28-companion-proactive-intentions-design.md`): the
companion authors dated follow-ups into `agenda.md`, and the push tick mechanically
fires due items (default = act) instead of polling.

The fire mechanism is **unit-proven** (`src/daemon/wiring/tick-bodies.ts` + its test:
a due agenda item → `acquire`+`dispatch`; nothing due → silent) and is
**production-correct** (agent and push tick both run on real time, so authored
due-dates and tick firing align). The acceptance run also confirmed the **author
path works** — the companion authored its own dated follow-ups from the conversation.

**Virtual-time was propagated (commits 92d63e6 + 5628c6c)** — `formatInbound` now emits
`ts` as ISO-8601 and `baseChannelSection` declares the envelope `ts` the authoritative
"now" over the SDK preset's real "Today's date" (spec
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-28-agent-current-time-authority-design.md`). This
**worked for date-authoring**: in a 6-run real-SDK check (long_silence + tech_stress, 3×
each) the companion authored agenda due-dates anchored to the *virtual* `ts`
(2026-05-1x) instead of the real wall-clock (previously 2026-06-03). The gate also
correctly dispatched the due items (no "no due intentions" logs).

But the e2e proactive probe was still **5/6 silent**: with the due item dispatched, the
agent **declined to send** in most runs. Pattern: the one run that fired had `due` == the
tick date; the silent runs had `due` several days *before* the tick — strongly
implicating the fire prompt's skip valve (*"只有明显已过期才不发"*) treating a few-days-overdue
follow-up as expired. So `long_silence_initiative` and `tech_stress_followup_v1` keep
their `proactive_decision` probe at `decision: n/a` (still asserting `must_not_recall`).
The fire mechanism remains **unit-proven** (`tick-bodies.test.ts`) and production-correct.

**Next lever (deferred, not in the ts-authority scope):** calibrate the fire prompt's
"已过期" skip valve so a slightly-overdue follow-up still fires (a few days' delay isn't
"expired"). That's a companion-prompt iteration; libfaketime was explicitly ruled out.

**Judge dimension scores — fixed (commit 78ccc85).** The first run's judge errored
on every probe (`Claude Code native binary not found … claude-agent-sdk-linux-x64-musl/claude`)
because it passed no `pathToClaudeCodeExecutable` and the SDK mis-detects the musl
native binary under bun on glibc. `run.ts` now resolves the binary (env
`CLAUDE_CODE_EXECUTABLE` → PATH, with an optional `pathToClaudeCodeExecutable`
override in `judge-config.json`) and threads it through. Verified: dimension
scores now produce (e.g. cross_domain_mixing → calibration 5.0 / restraint 5.0).
