 *   text      — assistant produced visible text (one event per SDK
 *               assistant block; can occur multiple times per turn).
 *   tool_call — assistant invoked a tool. `server` is set when the SDK
 *               distinguishes MCP server (Codex always; Claude after
 *               parsing the `mcp__SERVER__TOOL` name pattern). For
 *               built-in tools (Read, Bash, etc.) `server` is omitted.
 *   init      — session initialised; emitted once per dispatch by Codex
 *               (thread.started) and by Claude on first dispatch only
 *               (system{init} message). Consumers can ignore.
 *   result    — turn completed cleanly. Always followed by iterator
 *               close; one per dispatch.
 *   error     — turn failed at the SDK semantic layer (turn.failed,
 *               result.subtype !== 'success'). Iterator continues to
 *               close normally — true exceptions throw instead.
