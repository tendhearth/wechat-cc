 *               (thread.started) and by Claude on first dispatch only
 *               (system{init} message). Consumers can ignore.
 *   result    — turn completed cleanly. Always followed by iterator
 *               close; one per dispatch.
 *   error     — turn failed at the SDK semantic layer (turn.failed,
