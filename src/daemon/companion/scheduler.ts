 * Companion v2 scheduler — dead-simple periodic tick.

 * Replaces the v1 croner-based per-trigger scheduler. No more per-trigger
 * logic; no more isolated eval sessions. We only provide what Claude can't:
 * a timer that wakes it up.
 *
 * On every tick (when enabled + not snoozed), `onTick` is called. The
 * supplied onTick reads the chat's `agenda.md` and only wakes Claude when a
 * self-authored intention is due (default = act); when nothing is due it
 * returns silently without an LLM call.
