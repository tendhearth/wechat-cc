/**
 * Concatenate all .md files in a chat's memory dir into a single string.
 * Used by introspect (writes observations) AND summarizer (writes session
 * summaries) — both want the user's stated preferences + Claude's prior
 * notes as context. Same source of truth: when the user tells Claude in
 * chat "总结请像朋友说话", Claude writes that to memory; both downstream
 * SDK paths read it and adapt without any prompt code change here.
 *
 * Returns '' when the dir doesn't exist (new chat) or has no .md files.
